# Weed Detection and Control Using Computer Vision

This project implements an automated weed detection system using **YOLOv8** and computer vision techniques for real-time classification and targeted herbicide application. It aims to improve agricultural efficiency, reduce manual labor, and promote sustainable farming practices.

## Features
- **Real-Time Weed Detection**: Identifies weeds in high-resolution video streams with precision.
- **Drone Integration**: Guides drones to weed-infested areas for targeted herbicide application.
- **Sustainability**: Reduces chemical usage and minimizes environmental impact.
- **Scalability**: Adaptable to various crops, environments, and farm sizes.
- **Technology Stack**: Python, YOLOv8, OpenCV, Flask, and AWS/GCP.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rajchouhan19/Weed-Detection-and-Control-Using-Computer-Vision.git
   cd Weed-Detection-and-Control-Using-Computer-Vision
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Upload a video file or enable real-time video streaming via the drone camera.
2. Run the detection model to identify and classify weeds.
3. Deploy the drone for targeted herbicide spraying based on the model's output.

## Technologies Used
- **YOLOv8**: For object detection and weed classification.
- **OpenCV**: For image and video processing.
- **Flask**: For building the web interface.
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **AWS/GCP**: For deployment and scalability.
